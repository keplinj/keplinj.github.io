<h1 class="page-title">Floating Images in Text</h1>
        <div style="max-width:1167px">
<p>You can apply classes to images to make them float within text and/or resize responsively to various sizes. As a best practice, size full-width images at least <strong>1600px</strong> wide and half-width images at least <strong>800px</strong> wide.</p>
<h2>Banner &amp; Full</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The banner class just removes the top margin from the image; otherwise, it's the same as the "full" class. Use "banner" when your image is at the very top of the page and "full" when it's in the middle or at the bottom of a page.</p>
<p>Also, you'll find that Canvas sometimes automatically wraps paragraph tags around elements; you'll want to change them to div tags in the HTML editor if the paragraph tags are adding spacing you don't want.</p>

<h2>Right</h2>
         <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The "right" class floats a half-size image to the right of text.</p>
<p><img class="right" src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SXDpZLXGOsX-PuexCHwfi2hcN2I=/767x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7ETAHTHWWFC4JAM7UKWU2UGCVQ.jpg" />A Hoosier cat who became internet famous and helped her owners raise thousands of dollars for homeless pets across the state has died.</p>
<p>Lil Bub, who lived in Bloomington with her owner, Mike Bridavsky, had a rare bone condition that caused a deformity in her paws and dwarfism. She only weighed around four pounds and stayed the size of a kitten for her entire life. The vet told Lil Bub's owners that she would only live for a couple of years, but she died peacefully over the weekend at the ripe age of eight.</p>
<p>Lil Bub rose to fame the way most internet cats do &mdash; through channels like YouTube and Tumblr. Bridavsky began posting videos of Bub back in 2011, when she was still a kitten. At the behest of friends he also began posting photos on a Bub blog. Within the next year, the Twitter account had launched along with the Facebook page, and by the summer of 2012, the cat-hungry internet was fighting over who had loved her longer. BuzzFeed posted about her. So did Jezebel, which called her &ldquo;one of the weirdly cutest,&nbsp;Mogwai-looking mother*** cats you will ever see.&rdquo; But it was Vice that touted that &ldquo;we liked Lil Bub&nbsp;before anyone else did.&rdquo; (Talk about marking your territory.)</p>
<p>Thankfully, Vice put its money where it&rsquo;s mouth was with the Bub documentary, which investigates not only Bub&rsquo;s life but the larger phenomenon of internet cats, especially under<del>dogs</del>cats like Grumpy Cat and Maru.&nbsp;<em>Lil Bub and Friendz</em>&nbsp;premiered this spring and went on to win best online feature film at the Tribeca Film Festival. In addition to the doc and the book, Bub (with Mike&rsquo;s help, we imagine) launched a series with Revision3 called&nbsp;<em>Lil Bub&rsquo;s Big Show</em>. First guest? Whoopi Goldberg. &ldquo;She was the easiest part,&rdquo; Bridavsky says. &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;Hey Whoopi, do you want to do this?&rsquo; [She responded] &lsquo;Anything for you, Bub.'&rdquo; In an episode airing later this season,&nbsp;she&rsquo;ll collabo with Kelley Deal&nbsp;of the Breeders on Deal&rsquo;s new single.</p>
<p>Lil Bub also stared in a book in which she depicted a space cat who traveled to earth to hook up with her owner. The book featured more than 100 photos of Lil Bub and Mike and all proceeds went to animal organizations across the country.</p>
<p>In a tribute to Lil Bub posted Monday morning, Mike said she had helped the family raise more than $700,000 to help homeless animals across the state.</p>
